## Logic Analysis:

```python
[
    ("main.py", "Main"),
    ("game_engine.py", "Game"),
    ("game_engine.py", "Storyline"),
    ("game_engine.py", "Ending"),
    ("nlp_utils.py", "NLPUtils")
]
```

The dependencies between the files are as follows:
- `main.py` depends on `game_engine.py` and `nlp_utils.py`
- `game_engine.py` depends on `Storyline`, `Ending`, and `NLPUtils`

## Task list:

```python
[
    "nlp_utils.py",
    "game_engine.py",
    "main.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge:

```python
"""
The 'nlp_utils.py' file contains utility functions for natural language processing, such as generating descriptive text based on choices and adapting the storyline based on player input.

The 'game_engine.py' file contains the implementation of the game logic, including the Game, Storyline, and Ending classes.

The 'main.py' file is the entry point of the program and handles the user interface and game flow.

The 'main.py' file depends on the 'game_engine.py' and 'nlp_utils.py' files.

The 'game_engine.py' file depends on the 'Storyline', 'Ending', and 'NLPUtils' classes.

Make sure to initialize any necessary third-party libraries and handle any required configurations before starting the game.
